 Lab 1 for Mason getting the basics of OOP

 For your first assignment you need create an Interface for "animals" then classes for "birds", "fish", and "humans"
 All animals will have a maximum weight capacity (idk u can just make it up but make em different, u can have a giga strong bird benching 405 idrc lol). All animals will be able to move, carry something, drop something, and you should be able to check if the animal is holding something. The movement can be implemented by just having a string saying "flapping" for bird or "walking" for human. That is all have fun.
